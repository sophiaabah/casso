## About 

Casso migrates public playlists across two platforms: Deezer and Spotify. 

If you want to preview the webpage, please note that Spotify requires users to be registered in Casso's dashboard, before they can use Casso with their account. 

However, running the app locally with your access token would work normally.


## How to use 

Copy your playlist ID from the URL in your browser and start migrating!
